1. A program that keeps track of bank account information (name, account number,
   account type, balance)

    HashMap<Account_Number , Account_Data_Object>

    Where Account_Data_Object contains name, account type, balance.
    A common use case is to transfer money from one account to another (identified
    by account number) so being able to quickly locate the correct data object is important.

2. A phonebook program that stores your friends' names and phone numbers

    HashMap<Name , List<Phone_Numbers>>

    A common use case is finding the phone numbers of a given friend's name.

3. A program to inventory the contents of your refrigerator

    HashSet<Thing_In_Fridge>

4. A program that stores a list of your favourite fruits

    HashSet<Fruit>

5. A program that stores a list of the favourite fruits of all the students in your class

    HashMap<Student , List<Fruit>>

    I imagine a use case is to find the fruit that a given student likes.
